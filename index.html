                <p>
                    I grew up with a heavy emphasis on having a "Renaissance education," which for my family was defined as being educated about many things, not just academic things. We were taught to try new things, pursue them long enough to be comfortable with them, and then decide if they were what we wanted to focus on. We were also reminded about the importance of play being mixed in with the learning, which made experimenting with new things fun and enjoyable. This resulted in learning new things well.

            </div>
            <div class="div-2">
                <p>
                    Growing up with these diverse experiences and perspectives, along with holding citizenship in more than one country, informed both my career and my way of looking at life. Again, I find myself working in a field that requires a mixture of skills: Analytical and creative; theoretical, academically-informed, and practical.

            <div class="div-3">
                <p>
                    Curiosity, being adventurous, and having an innate need to explore and understand things all fuel my constant learning, practice, and growth. Finding joy in the unexpected just adds to the experience. This does not negate the role that practice lends to growth, as without practice, excellence cannot be achieved.
